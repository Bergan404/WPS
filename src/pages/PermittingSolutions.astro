                Why Permitting Solutions Matter
            </h4>
            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Whether you're planning new construction or renovations,
                navigating local permit requirements can be time-consuming and
                complex. With Whiddon Property Solutions, we ensure that all the
                necessary forms are properly handled, submitted, and
                approvedâ€”taking the guesswork out of permitting.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                An expired or open permit remains on a property's record for
                years, and even if the property changes hands, the associated
                issues persist with the property itself rather than individual
                owners.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Permit violations pose a significant hurdle in real estate
                transactions. If permit issues go undetected during the sale,
                the consequences can be severe, as any outstanding violations
                then become the responsibility of the new owner(s)
