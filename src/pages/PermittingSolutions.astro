                Why Permitting Solutions Matter
            </h4>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Existing open and expired permits recorded on properties are far greater issues than what most people would expect. Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach County are all cracking down and becoming more and more aggressive and take property compliance very seriously especially when a real estate transaction, transfer of title, or work/construction/renovations are being done on the subject property.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Open permits and Expired permits are often retained in a propertyâ€™s records for many years, and even if the property changes hands, the associated issues remain tied to the property rather than the individual owner.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Permit violations can present a significant barrier in real estate transactions. If permit issues are overlooked during the sale process, the consequences can be severe, as any unresolved violations are transferred to the new owner(s).
            </p>

            <p class="text-center py-3">
                Whiddon Property Solutions has devoted themselves to ensuring each and every permitting issue and its processes are handled with utmost care and delicacy in a timely manner, so that the client can sell or renovate their home without the inconvenience of tampering with their timeline and schedules.
